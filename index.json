BKS$^2$DR learns an easily interpretable low-dimensional representation of the covariates that is predictive of a response variable. Our method is free of any distributional assumptions and is able to capture non-linear dependencies between the covariates and the response. We design a new loss, which penalizes each low-dimensional representation by the distance of its Gram matrix from the response Gram matrix, constructed using a positive-definite Kernel, and adopt a loss-based approach characterizing uncertainty via the resulting Gibbs posterior distribution. The learned low-dimensional representation can be used for a downstream regression task, avoiding the issues of estimating a model in the original, high-dimensional space.We validate our method through extensive simulations showcasing its robustness to heavy-tailed noise in high-dimensional and moderate-sample size scenarios.We apply our method to an environmental epidemiology dataset, highlighting the ability to reduce dimensionality in modeling complex exposure effects while maintaining interpretability and predictive accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"Generalized Bayes Kernel Similarity for Supervised Dimensionality Reduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Stochastic Gradient (SG) Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) are popular algorithms for Bayesian sampling in the presence of large datasets.
